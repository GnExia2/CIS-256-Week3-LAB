Task 1:

Implement linear search, given a list of names and a target name you are searching for.

    Search will not be case sensitive, test your function so that if 'NAME' is stored in the list and 'name' is target, it will return index of 'NAME'



Task 2:

Implement binary search recursively, given a list of names and a target name you are searching for.

    Search will not be case sensitive, same as Task 1



Task 3:

    Calculate time complexity using big O notation for both Task 1 and Task 2, compare results.
    For Task 2 and previous Lab 1 Sierpinski triangle algorithms you implemented, generate Recursive Trees. Compare results and discuss what made one algorithm more efficient than the other.

What to submit:

    Your source code .java (and any other files for bonus work)
    A screenshot of the output you will have while testing your program
    Word doc calculating time complexity, depicting recursive trees, and discussing results
